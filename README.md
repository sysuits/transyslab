## Overview

TranSysLab is a traffic flow simulation platform for large scale urban network, 
which is developed by Research Center of Intelligent Transportation System, Sun Yat-sen University. 

The project consists of a simulation software, tutorials and several scenarios files. 
The latter two are coming soon.

TranSysLab offers: 

- calibration toolbox 
- parallel simulation speedup
- GUI for basic simulation task

For more information, see the project website at http://www.transyslab.com, 
which is also coming soon.
